      "ANS1": "You can do it either way, though we highly encourage you to empower your group leaders to create their own groups.",
      "ANS2": "If you create the group for your leaders, then you can invite the group leader to be a co-leader of the group. Once they sign-up, you'll have the option to transfer the group to them.",
      "ANS3": "But, we have found that you will get more \"buy in\" if the group leaders create their own groups. They'll feel a sense of ownership over their group, and as you grow, you'll be glad you're only having to approve the group, not enter all the details for tens or hundreds of groups."

      "QUEST": "We have a lot of different ministries, not just small groups. Can I customize Smallgroups.church?",
