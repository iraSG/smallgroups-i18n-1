This repository contains the text for the Smallgroups.church website. If you (or your church) is interested in translating this into your language, please follow the instructions below.

## Instructions
1. Create a [github.com](https://github.com/join) account
   - Complete account information in Step 1.
   - Select `Unlimited public repositories for free.` in Step 2.
   - Click the `skip this step` link at the bottom of Step 3.
   - Verify your email address -- you'll need to do this before you can modify files in step 2 below.
   - Come back to this repository [https://github.com/1thrasher/smallgroups-i18n](https://github.com/1thrasher/smallgroups-i18n)

2. Find the file that you would like to edit (under your language) in the file listings above. (If your language is not listed, please contact us at hello@smallgroups.church.)
   - Select the file you want to modify
   - Click the pencil icon in the top-right that says, 'Fork this project and edit the file'.
   - Make the necessary translation updates:
  
     When editing the files, **do not** modify any of the text inside of curly braces. For example, you would not translate the word name in the following `What is your {{name}}?`.

     When editing the \*.json file, **do not** modify any of the CAPITALIZED keys, rather only translate the text in quotes to the right of the colon (:) of each key.
     
     At any time, click the 'Preview changes' button at the top to see your updates.

3. After completing your translations, preview your changes to ensure correctness.
